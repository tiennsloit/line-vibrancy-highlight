# Line Vibrancy

**Line Vibrancy** helps you highlight the current line (or lines) in Visual Studio Code by dimming all others with a background overlay. This is especially useful during code sharing or screen recordings, making it easier for others to follow along.

## Features

- **Current Line Highlight**: Press `Cmd+Alt+Z` (or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` on Windows/Linux) to dim all lines except the current one.
- **Platform Support**: Fully supported on macOS and Windows. Linux support may vary.
